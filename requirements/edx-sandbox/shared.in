# Core dependencies shared between Python sandboxes for secured execution and edx-platform.
#
# DON'T JUST ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES!!!

# If you open a pull request that adds a new dependency, you should:
#   * verify that the dependency has a license compatible with AGPLv3
#   * confirm that it has no system requirements beyond what we already install
#   * run "make upgrade" to update the detailed requirements files
