# Prequisites
# 1) You must have devstack up and running
# 2) You must have hub installed (brew install hub)
# 3) You must have a publickey set up with github (so hub can make your PR)

# How To Run
# 1) Have devstack up and running (via `make dev.up` in your devstack repo)
# 2) On the command line, go into your edx-platform repo checkout
# 3) Make sure you are on the master branchof edx-platform with no changes
# 4) Run this script from the root of the repo, handing it your username, ticketname, and subdirectory to convert:
#     ./scripts/py2_to_py3_convert_and_create_pr.sh cpappas INCR-1234 common/lib/calc

help_text="\nUsage: ./scripts/py2_to_py3_convert_and_create_pr.sh <username> <ticket-name> <subdirectory>\n";
help_text+="Example: ./scripts/py2_to_py3_convert_and_create_pr.sh cpappas INCR-1234 common/lib/calc\n\n";

        printf "$help_text";
        exit 0;
    fi
